<!-- This unit test covers things the reader tolerates but are invalid XML and HTML5. -->
<div>
  <span>We open a span but don't close it.
  <span>In fact, we open a span within a span.
  <br>But it's the surrounding div that closes it all.
  <br>That's bad HTML. Spans can be nested but should have end-tags.
</div>
<zz:top>
  A namespace will be created for an <zz:Hello yyz:rush="music">arbitrary</zz:Hello> prefix. This is extra tolerance beyond XML or HTML requirements.
</zz:top>
<p>
  This paragraph has a <br>break with an</br>end-tag but break is a void element.
  It also includes an </hr> end hr tag and an </span> end span tag without matching begin tags.
</p>
<div id="<h1>Invalid ID</h1>">This Div has &lt; and &gt; in the ID which are invalid.</div>
<xy:morestuff>This is bad syntax in HTML or XML but this is a tolerant reader.
